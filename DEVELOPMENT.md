### ⚓ Core Files

#### ragnar.py

The main entry point for the application. It initializes and runs the main components, including the network scanner, orchestrator, display, and web server.

#### comment.py

Handles generating all the ragnar comments displayed on the e-Paper HAT based on different themes/actions and statuses.

#### display.py

Manages the e-Paper HAT display, updating the screen with ragnar character, the dialog/comments, and the current information such as network status, vulnerabilities, and various statistics.

### ▶️ Actions

#### actions/scanning.py

Conducts network scanning to identify live hosts and open ports. It updates the network knowledge base (`netkb`) and generates scan results.

#### actions/nmap_vuln_scanner.py

- **steal_files_ssh.py**: Steals files from SSH servers.
- **steal_files_telnet.py**: Steals files from Telnet servers.
- **steal_data_sql.py**: Extracts data from SQL databases.
 
### 📇 Data Structure

#### Network Knowledge Base (netkb.csv)

Located at `data/netkb.csv`. Stores information about:

- Known hosts and their status. (Alive or offline)
- Open ports and vulnerabilities.
- Action execution history. (Success or failed)

**Preview Example:**

![netkb1](https://github.com/infinition/ragnar/assets/37984399/f641a565-2765-4280-a7d7-5b25c30dcea5)

#### Scan Results

Located in `data/output/scan_results/`.
This file is generated everytime the network is scanned. It is used to consolidate the data and update netkb.

**Example:**

![Scan result](https://github.com/infinition/ragnar/assets/37984399/eb4a313a-f90c-4c43-b699-3678271886dc)

- Other runtime statistics.

## 📖 Detailed Project Description

### 👀 Behavior of ragnar

Once launched, ragnar performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Loads configuration, initializes shared data, and sets up necessary components such as the e-Paper HAT display.
2. **Network Scanning**: Scans the network to identify live hosts and open ports. Updates the network knowledge base (`netkb`) with the results.
3. **Orchestration**: Orchestrates different actions based on the configuration and network knowledge base. This includes performing vulnerability scanning, attacks, and file stealing.
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Performs vulnerability scans on identified hosts and updates the vulnerability summary.
5. **Brute-Force Attacks and File Stealing**: Starts brute-force attacks and steals files based on the configuration criteria.
6. **Display Updates**: Continuously updates the e-Paper HAT display with current information such as network status, vulnerabilities, and various statistics. ragnar also displays random comments based on different themes and statuses.
7. **Web Server**: Provides a web interface for monitoring and interacting with ragnar.

## ▶️ Running ragnar

### 📗 Manual Start

To manually start ragnar (without the service, ensure the service is  stopped « sudo systemctl stop ragnar.service »):

```bash
cd /home/ragnar/ragnar

# Run ragnar
sudo python ragnar.py
```

### 🕹️ Service Control

Control the ragnar service:

```bash
# Start ragnar
sudo systemctl start ragnar.service

# Stop ragnar
sudo systemctl stop ragnar.service

# Check status
sudo systemctl status ragnar.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u ragnar.service
```

### 🪄 Fresh Start

To reset ragnar to a clean state:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /home/ragnar/ragnar/config/*.json \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/*.csv \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/*.log \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/output/data_stolen/* \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/output/crackedpwd/* \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/config/* \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/output/scan_results/* \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/config/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/actions/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/resources/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/web/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/*.log \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/resources/waveshare_epd/__pycache__ \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/logs/* \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/output/vulnerabilities/* \
    /home/ragnar/ragnar/data/logs/*

```

Everything will be recreated automatically at the next launch of ragnar.

## ❇️ Important Configuration Files

### 🔗 Shared Configuration (`shared_config.json`)

Defines various settings for ragnar, including:

- Boolean settings (`manual_mode`, `websrv`, `debug_mode`, etc.).
- Time intervals and delays.
- Network settings.
- Port lists and blacklists.
These settings are accessible on the webpage.

### 🛠️ Actions Configuration (`actions.json`)

Lists the actions to be performed by ragnar, including (dynamically generated with the content of the folder):

- Module and class definitions.
- Port assignments.
- Parent-child relationships.
- Action status definitions.

## 📟 E-Paper Display Support

Currently, hardcoded for the 2.13-inch V2 & V4 e-Paper HAT. 
My program automatically detect the screen model and adapt the python expressions into my code.

For other versions:
- As I don't have the v1 and v3 to validate my algorithm, I just hope it will work properly.

### 🍾 Ghosting Removed!
In my journey to make ragnar work with the different screen versions, I struggled, hacking several parameters and found out that it was possible to remove the ghosting of screens! I let you see this, I think this method will be very useful for all other projects with the e-paper screen!

## ✍️ Development Guidelines

### ➕ Adding New Actions

1. Create a new action file in `actions/`.
2. Implement required methods:
   - `__init__(self, shared_data)`
   - `execute(self, ip, port, row, status_key)`
3. Add the action to `actions.json`.
4. Follow existing action patterns.

### 🧪 Testing

1. Create a test environment.
2. Use an isolated network.
3. Follow ethical guidelines.
4. Document test cases.

## 💻 Web Interface

- **Access**: `http://[device-ip]:8000`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time monitoring with a console.
  - Configuration management.
  - Viewing results. (Credentials and files)
  - System control.

## 🧭 Project Roadmap

### 🪛 Current Focus

- Stability improvements.
- Bug fixes.
